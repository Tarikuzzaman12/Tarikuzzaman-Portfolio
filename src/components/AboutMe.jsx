                I started my programming journey a few years ago when I was first introduced to HTML and CSS. It sparked my interest in web development, and I dove deeper into learning JavaScript and frontend frameworks like React. Since then, I’ve built several projects, honed my skills, and developed a passion for coding and problem-solving. Every new project excites me, and I’m constantly pushing myself to learn more and stay up to date with the latest trends in frontend development.
